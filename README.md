# sibylla
Asynchronous Promise based functional style utilities with full TypeScript support

sibylla — /siˈbyl.la/. The sibyls were oracles (prophetesses) in Ancient Greece. As for any other prophets their predictions will be someway fulfilled in the future (resolved or rejected). That’s the similarity with Promises in JavaScript.
